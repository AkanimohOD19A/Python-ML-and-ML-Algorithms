# Python-ML-and-ML-Algorithms
## An introduction to Machine Learning and Machine Learning Algorithms

In these notebooks, are my first attempts at Machine Learning using the Python programming language, the process involved downloading datasets from Kaggle, and following tutorials on specific problems, and applications. In these notebooks we will see an approach to Binary Classification and Continuous Regression problems using suitable models, which are then searched for best hyper-Parameters, and then fitted to generate a prediction, which is finally tested on the validation dataset.

As always this is a Labour of love, and a great starting point for ML Beginners, and as a Beginner I am open to any criticism or reccomendation.
